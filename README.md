 This includes some of the datasets and scripts used to process and analyze genotypic data to detect crossovers between dysgenic and non-dysgenic progeny in Drosophila virilis crosses.
 
 The scripts and data include the following:
 
 - Run the Multiplex Shotgun Genotyping (MSG) pipeline (available to download from <https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/msg>, citation here: <https://dx.doi.org/10.1101%2Fgr.115402.110>)
 - Process and clean the outputs from the MSG pipeline into a dataframe of crossovers in each sample and per cross
 - Do a statistical analysis of crossover data using generalized linear models
 - Produce Figures 1, 2, and 3 with ggplot2
